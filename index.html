            <p><h4> HTML consists of a series of elements, which you use to enclose, or wrap,
                 different parts of the content to make it appear a certain way, or act a certain way.
                 The enclosing tags can make a word or image hyperlink to somewhere else, can italicize words,
                  can make the font bigger or smaller, and so on. </h4></p>

                     JavaScript is an easy to learn and also powerful scripting language,

                    <p><h4>React is a library for building composable user interfaces. 
                        It encourages the creation of reusable UI components, which present data that changes over time. 
                        Lots of people use React as the V in MVC. React abstracts away the DOM from you, 
                        offering a simpler programming model and better performance. 
                        React can also render on the server using Node,
                         and it can power native apps using React Native.</h4></p>
